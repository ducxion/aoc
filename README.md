Advent of Code is an annual coding puzzle/challenge for any programming language. I try to take part every year since 2020 and upload my approaches to github for posterity. My solutions use the following languages:

2020: Python
2021: Python

// from the Author of AoC:

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
